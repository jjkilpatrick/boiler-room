# Getting Started

Firstly run the node graphql server:

### `npm server` or `yarn server`

Open http://localhost:4000/graphiql to view the graphql in-browser IDE.

When the server is running, run the app in development mode by running:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
